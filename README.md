# EE2028
A school project for STM32L475 Microprocessor.
Have added the feature of computing the distance between point 1 and centroid 1 ONLY. 

# Week 4 Assignment 1
Changes to be made include:
Being able to compute the distance between point 1 and centroid 2.


Comparing which distance is larger.🚧
classify point 1 to either CLASS 1 or 2.🚧
