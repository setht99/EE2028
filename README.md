# EE2028
A school project for STM32L475 Microprocessor.
Have added the feature of computing the distance between point 1 and centroid 1 ONLY. 

# Week 4 Assignment 1
Changes to be made include:
Being able to compute the distance between point 1 and centroid 2. - DONE **(Don't touch R7 its for printing)**


~~Comparing which distance is larger.🚧 - DONE<br/>
classify point 1 to either CLASS 1 or 2.🚧 - DONE<br/>~~  
Add C object from define to memory
**NOW WE HAVE TO DO ALL THESE IN A LOOP!**

- **Date:** `9/09/2021`
- **Sprint manager:** Rach/Seth😛
- **Related project:** EE2028 Main
